# JKIL Arrows (linux)

```
  I        ↑
J K L    ← ↓ →
```

The currently working solution is to implement the mapping [via xkb](xkb)

Previously, [I was using](autokey) AutoKey to make `jkil->arrows` mapping. But it has several drawbacks. First, autokey doesn't discern between left and right alt, which led to some hacks needed in order to keep some hotkeys available (`ctrl+alt+l`, for example). And the second, sometimes, Autokey just slows down and freezes. Which is a no go.
