### Cursor on `JKIL` keys.

Once you tried to use `ijkl` instead of cursor keys (notice - these keys compose the same pyramid as you used to) - it is impossible to go back. It is invaluable when you don't have to take your right hand off the keys to navigate a cursor - you just use `Right Alt` (or `Right ⌘`) with `ijkl` and move a cursor without leaving right hand typing position.

This project contains a set of configs for different OSs to setup `ijkl` cursor that will work in ANY application (explorer, finder, browser, your IDE). So you don't have to rely on application's inner cursor crafts (VIM, etc.), instead, you use `ijkl` consistently across any application.

* navigate cursor without leaving your typing position
* press `Enter`, `Delete`, and other without leaving your typing position
* consistent cursor hot-keys across all applications, system-wide
* additional keys difficult to reach or absent on some keyboards (`PgUp`, `PgDown`, `Home`, `End`, `Delete`, `Remove`, `Enter`)
* works with `Shift`, `Ctrl`, etc.

Press `Right Alt` (`Right ⌘`) plus...
* `RAlt + ijkl` - up, left, down, right
* `RAlt + ;` - Enter
* `RAlt + u` - Home
* `RAlt + p` - End
* `RAlt + y` - PgUp
* `RAlt + h` - PgDown
* `RAlt + m` - Remove
* `RAlt + n` - Delete

Also, I am remapping `Ctrl + RAlt + j` to 10 pressings of `Left` instead of to `Ctrl + Left` (same for `Up, Down, Right`). I believe, that it is much more convenient in the long run. *Todo: make a deeper justification in a separate statement, or remove as questionable.*
