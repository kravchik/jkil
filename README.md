# Keyboard tweaks

## JKIL Arrows

[Map ← ↓ ↑ → to JKIL](jkil)

Mapping of arrows and some other Home-Ends to the right hand.

Once you tried to use `ijkl` instead of cursor keys (notice - these keys compose the same pyramid as you used to) - it is impossible to go back. It is invaluable when you don't have to take your right hand off the keys to navigate a cursor - you just use `Right Alt` (or `Right ⌘`) with `ijkl` and move a cursor without leaving right hand typing position.

## Switch Ctrl <-> Alt

[Switch Alt<->Ctrl](ctrlalt)

Mac has many strange decisions but its `⌘+c`, `⌘+v` - is far far far more convenient than win/linux `Ctrl+c`, `Ctrl+v` because you can use your thumb to press `⌘` instead of pinky `Ctrl`. Once you used to it, there is no turning back.
