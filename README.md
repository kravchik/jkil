Mapping of arrows and some other Home-Ends to the right hand.

Once you tried to use `ijkl` instead of cursor keys (notice - these keys compose the same pyramid as you used to) - it is impossible to go back. It is invaluable when you don't have to take your right hand off the keys to navigate a cursor. Instead - you just use `Right Alt` (or `Right ⌘`) with `ijkl` and move a cursor without leaving the typing position.

## Switch (mostly) Ctrl <-> Alt

[Switch Alt<->Ctrl](ctrlalt)

Mac has many strange decisions but its `⌘+c`, `⌘+v` - is far far far more convenient than win/linux `Ctrl+c`, `Ctrl+v` because you can use your thumb to press `⌘` instead of pinky `Ctrl`. Once you used to it, there is no turning back.

Note! This is not just a simple switch of `Ctrl <-> Alt` keys!  Because in that case, one should also do something with all the hot-keys many of which are not a simple task to remap (because they are system - `Alt+Tab`, `Alt+F4`, etc.). Let alone many app-specific hot-keys.
So, in this solution - we are ONLY remapping `Alt+KEY` and letting everything else be.
