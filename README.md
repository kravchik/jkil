# Cursor on IJKL keys.

TODO picture

IJKL cursor for any OS

Once you tried to use `ijkl` instead of cursor keys (notice - these keys compose the same pyramid as you used to) - it is impossible to go back. It is invaluable when you don't have to take your right hand off the keys to navigate a cursor. Instead - you just use Alt (or Command) with `ijkl` and move a cursor without.

This project contains a set of configs for different OSs to setup `ijkl` cursor that will work in ANY application (explorer, finder, browser, your IDE). So you don't have to rely on applications inner cursor crafts (VIM, etc.), instead, you use `ijkl` consistently across any application.

* navigate cursor without leaving the keyboard
* consistent cursor hot-keys across all applications
* additional keys difficult to reach or absent on many keyboards (PgUp, PgDown, Home, End, Delete, Remove, Enter)
* works in familiar combination with Shift, Ctrl, etc.

Press Alt (Command) plus...
* `Alt + ijkl` - up, left, down, right
* `Alt + ;` - Enter
* `Alt + u` - Home
* `Alt + p` - End
* `Alt + y` - PgUp
* `Alt + h` - PgDown
* `Alt + m` - Remove
* `Alt + n` - Delete
