# Switch Ctrl and Alt

Mac has many strange decisions but its `Command+zxcv` (redo, cut, copy, past) - is far far far more convinient than win/linux `Ctrl+zxcv`

This dir is about switching `ctrl` and `alt` for linux and win.

## Win

TODO

## Linux

1. switch left Alt and left Ctrl system wide [this is how](https://askubuntu.com/questions/93624/how-do-i-swap-left-ctrl-with-left-alt-on-my-keyboard)

2. switch 'close window' hot key

3. via Autokey, send `ctrl+tab`, `ctrl+shift+tab` via pressing new `alt+tab`, `alt+shift+tab` (for Chrome and other apps)
