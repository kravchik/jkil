## Switch (mostly) Ctrl <-> Alt

[Switch Alt<->Ctrl](ctralt/README.md)

Mac has many strange decisions but its `⌘+c`, `⌘+v` - is far far far more convenient than win/linux `Ctrl+c`, `Ctrl+v` because you can use your thumb to press ⌘ instead of pinky Ctrl. Once you used to it, there is no turning back.

In this approach, it is just left ctrl/alt keys switched. Just download and double-click [the registry file](ctr-alt.reg).
If you want to revert the changes - just use [another registry file](remove.ctr-alt.reg).

In this approach, it is just left ctrl/alt keys switched. This means that all shortcuts change to:

* cycle windows -> `ctrl+tab`
* close window -> `ctrl+F4`
* cycle tabs in chrome -> `alt+tab`
* access menu -> `ctrl+key`

I tried to handle those with different approaches but ended up that it is simpler to just get used to it.
